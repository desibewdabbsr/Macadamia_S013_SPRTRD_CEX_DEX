The bot uses the Supertrend indicator as its primary strategy to book profits. Hereâ€™s how it works:

Supertrend Calculation: The Supertrend indicator is calculated using the average of the high and low prices, along with a multiplier of the Average True Range (ATR). It creates two bands around the price, an upper and a lower band.

Trend Determination: The bot determines the trend by comparing the current price with these bands. If the price is above the upper band, the market is considered in an uptrend, suggesting a buy signal. Conversely, if the price is below the lower band, the market is in a downtrend, indicating a sell signal.

Position Entry: When the bot identifies a change from a downtrend to an uptrend, it executes a buy order. This is based on the assumption that the uptrend will continue and lead to a profitable opportunity.

Position Exit: Similarly, when the bot notices a change from an uptrend to a downtrend, it executes a sell order. This is to book profits (or cut losses) assuming that the downtrend might lead to a decrease in price.

Profit Booking: The profit is booked when the bot sells the asset at a higher price than the buying price during an uptrend.
